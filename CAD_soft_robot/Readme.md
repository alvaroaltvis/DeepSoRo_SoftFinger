# Molds
The inside and outside molds are used to create the main body of the soft finger, they are created with Grey Pro from Formlabs3 3D printer. Use the recommended wash time and casting time. The soft finger is made with ecoFlex 0030. 

# Base and Caps
The base and the caps are printed with Flexible 80 from Formlabs 3D printers. Use the recommended wash and cast techniques. 

# Exoskeleton 
The exoskeleton is made with Grey Pro and Tough 1500 from the Formlabs 3D printers. They are similar in elasticity but the Tough 1500 provides much more durability. 
When printing the exoskeleton, make sure that it is facing upwards, meaning that the flat top of the exoskeleton is in direct contact with the tray. Also, make sure there aren't any inner supports as that will make it difficult to remove. Let in the bath for 15 minutes and then remove support. NEVER CAST, it makes it too fragile. 

# Making soft Finger

When putting together the inner and outer mold, make sure the inner mold fits right into the DFA feature inside the hole of the outer mold. There is a small bump that makes placing the inner mold easy. 

Use ecoFlex 0030. Mix the two bases on a 1:1 ratio. Use the vacuum two absorb all the air bubbles inside the ecoflex, do this process twice. Once it is done, set the mold, tightly screwed together, on a flat surface, and pour the ecoflex slowly and uniformly on top of the mold. You can use mold release spray if wanted but it leaves a sticky surface on the finger that is hard to later wash off. To remove, carefully pill separate the ecoFlex from the walls of the mold. Then by holding the mold down, pull the inside section slowly but repeatedly, it will start to get loose and after a few minutes, you will be able to remove it.  

Note: You can sand down the connections of the mold before using. Nonetheless, if overdone, this may provoke some leakage.
